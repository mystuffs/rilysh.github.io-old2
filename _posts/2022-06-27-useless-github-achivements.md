## What is GitHub?
If you're new to GitHub a little intro would be helpful. GitHub is a code hosting platform for open source projects, it was founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P.J. Hyett and Scott Chacon. GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in June 4, 2018. It's now the most popular open source project hosting site. 

## Why you shall not use GitHub?
When GitHub is great on its own, it most likely was great until 2019. After getting popular GitHub started to change stuff a lot, therefore they've also changed their old planning about limited private repos' within a budget, now GitHub allows unlimited public and private repos' without any monthly cost. (This is also a reason why they suddenly earned so much popularity) With this new feature, many developers were attracted to GitHub and now what GitHub is right now.

Every year they've added some new features and not all features were great, for example, GitHub recently added GitHub codespace which is completely paid, (GitHub codespace is an online VSCode IDE). It sounds cool but GitHub wasn't made for this. They already have an online IDE for each repository (open a repo and press "." to open the VSCode web version or go to github.dev and select your repository).
This truly made GitHub bloated, as, like others, I'm not and never be comfortable code editing in the browser it doesn't matter how much performance they're going to give, the rest of them wouldn't bother with it, therefore this feature became useless. I don't know does they ever care about it.

About two days ago, GitHub added the achievements feature. An achievement feature is like a badge or icon which will be on your profile according to your activity on GitHub.

* Pull Shark: Whenever you'll create 2 or pull requests, GitHub will add a pull shark badge on your profile.
* Galaxy Brain: Answering 2 or more discussion questions will give you this badge.
* YOLO: If you merged a pull request without reviewing it, GitHub will add a YOLO badge on your profile.

Note: Any previous pull request, discussion answer, or merge without review will also give you the badge.

Now let's jump to the actual point, what is the problem with the badges or icons? If you understand how today's world works you may already know the answer, the terms of usage of these words aren't professional, "Pull Shark", "Galaxy Brain" and "YOLO" doesn't make any sense of anything that can be particularly identified. In 2020 GitHub additionally added a badge which was for GitHub 2020 archive program and the badge name was "Arctic Code Vault". If you compare it with the above-mentioned badges you'll find that that one uses quite informal words which none of us like (except those who're web developers and compare themselves as Software Engineer).

Term "Pull Shark" word, I don't know what to say as I don't have an idea what it points, "Galaxy Brain" again what does it sounds like their brain is Galaxy? Is programming everything in this galaxy? and last one "YOLO" is slang. It rarely is used while chatting. 
In fact, except for those crappy meanings, these badges can increase spam PRs and merge without a review of what they've changed. These badges not only stay to show you got "useless" stuff but also have 2x, 3x, and 4x tiers. This will increase the count of PRs. You created 2 PRs you got the badge, you created 16 PRs you got a 2x sign on your badge, and so on.

I don't know what they even do, and I like never going to check where they did PR and how popular the repo was. Having a readme for your profile is enough to know about you, with some worthless badge and readme and other junks made GitHub more like a social gathering site rather than an open source code hosting platform.

## Alternatives are never good, why?
GitHub alternatives like GitLab (a most popular competitor of GitHub), BitBucket, and others are never a good alternative to GitHub. As I told you before GitHub is now the most popular among students, teachers, developers, and other folks. It's the heart of open source right nowadays. The reasons are obvious GitHub have a lot more feature than GitLab, (GitHub supports a huge list of programming languages and CI or simply GitHub actions). It's easy to use, much more customizable than GitLab and more importantly, it's faster than GitLab and its easy-to-use management dashboard makes it more comfortable to handle each job.

GitHub also has a feature called sponsorship on profile. It's like a button (in web language, a but-component) that allows other developers to help a particular developer by donating a couple of bucks per month.
 
I've never used BitBucket, have no idea but I suppose they don't have any CI feature (yet?).

## What I can use instead of GitHub?
Even though most of the alternatives aren't good enough to override GitHub, still I'd suggest trying GitLab. It's the only most popular alternative to GitHub. But it's not that much popular with newbies. And for sponsorship, I'd suggest trying "buy me a coffee" and "Patreon" (search them). They're the best alternative or another way to get sponsors for a particular project or a person.

Or if you don't want to try GitLab, I'd suggest checking self-hosted git. Just search (self-hosted git), the program itself is written in Golang and has complete features like an older version of GitHub (like was 2012 or so). If you don't want to host it by yourself, you may try some already running instances, for example, [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) and [gaygit](https://gitunix.lgbt).

I know that these all alternatives are quite barebones. So far there are only some alternatives that exist, for now since GitHub is a closed source there's no way to get the same as GitHub hosted by a community. Thank you for reading, have a sweet day!
